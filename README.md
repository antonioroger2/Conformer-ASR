# ConformerSpeechRecognizer
A Conformer-based end-to-end speech recognition system. It utilizes a Conformer encoder, which integrates convolutional and transformer architectures to capture both local and global acoustic dependencies. The system employs a CTC decoder to align input speech frames with output text sequences, without requiring explicit frame-level annotations.
